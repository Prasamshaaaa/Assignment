Q.N.1. This JavaScript script calculates the sum of integers in a given array. To use, simply modify the 'numbers' array with your desired integers and run the script. The result, displaying the sum of the integers, will be shown in the console. The script employs a concise function to iterate through the array and add up its elements, making it a handy tool for quickly obtaining the sum of an array of integers in a programming project.

Q.N.2. This JavaScript script efficiently identifies the maximum and minimum elements in a given array. It first checks if the array is empty, returning an appropriate message if so. The script then iterates through the array, updating the maximum and minimum values accordingly. After execution, the maximum and minimum elements are displayed in the console. This script is versatile and offers a quick solution for finding extreme values in an array, accommodating both non-empty and empty array cases.

Q.N.3 The JavaScript program reverses a given string without using any built-in methods. The `reverseString` function iterates through the input string in reverse order, constructing the reversed string character by character. To use the script, input your desired string into the `originalString` variable and run it. The console will then display both the original and reversed strings. This straightforward script offers a practical demonstration of string reversal without relying on pre-existing functions.

Q.N.4 The provided JavaScript program aims to reverse a given string in place without relying on built-in methods. The `reverseString` function takes the input string and splits it into two segments, reversing each part independently. The first segment is reversed from the beginning to a specific index (in this case, from the end of the string to index 4), while the second segment is reversed from that index to the end of the string. The results are then concatenated, representing the reversed string in place. To utilize the script, input your desired string into the `originalString` variable and execute the code. The console will showcase both the original and reversed strings, demonstrating an unconventional yet functional approach to in-place string reversal.

Q.N.5 The provided JavaScript function efficiently extracts unique elements from a given array, creating a new array containing only those distinct values. The function utilizes a loop to iterate through the input array, checking for each element's presence in the `uniqueArray` using the `includes` method. If an element is not already included, it gets appended to the `uniqueArray`. To use this functionality, insert your desired array into the `input` variable and execute the script. The console will then display both the original array and the resulting array containing only the unique elements. This script offers a simple and effective way to filter out duplicates from an array.

Q.N.6. The JavaScript function efficiently counts the occurrences of each character in a given string. Using an object to store the counts, the function iterates through the input string, incrementing the count for each character encountered. To utilize this functionality, input your desired string into the `input` variable and execute the script. The console will then display both the original string and an object containing the occurrences of each character. This straightforward script provides a quick way to analyze and tally character frequencies within a given string.
